title: Synthetic data
description: Synthetic datasets are used to easily test engines under certain conditions. These datasets differ in size, dimensionality, payload and filter types. Name structure is `<payload>-<dim>`, e.g. `keyword-100`. Datasets with vectors dimensionality `100` contain `1,000,000` records, and those with dim `2048` contain `100,000` records.
