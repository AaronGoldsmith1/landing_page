title: Single node filtered search benchmark
description: We proceeded our benchmarks and this time measured how most popular open-source search engines perform filtered search. We chose the same configuration for each engine and tested them on different datasets. These datasets include both synthetic and real-world data with various filters from exact match to presence in geo area or float range.
