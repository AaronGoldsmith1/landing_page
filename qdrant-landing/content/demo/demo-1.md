description: This demo uses short descriptions of startups to perform a semantic search. Each startup description converted into a vector using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model and uploaded to the Qdrant vector search engine. Demo service processes text input with the same model and uses its output to query Qdrant for similar vectors. You can turn neural search on and off to compare the result with regular full-text search.
