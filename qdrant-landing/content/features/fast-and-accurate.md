Qdrant implements a unique custom modification of the [HNSW algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320) for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search. (TBD) \
This algorithm allows Qdrant to search with a [State-of-the-Art speed](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) and apply search filters without [losing the results](https://blog.vasnetsov.com/posts/categorical-hnsw/).
