User behavior can be represented as a semantic vector is similar way as text or images.
This vector can represent the user's preferences, behavior patterns, or interest in the product.

With Qdrant, user vectors can be updated in real-time, no need to deploy a MapReduce cluster.\
Besides, Qdrant will allow you to place arbitrary restrictions on recommendations.
What if the user signed up 3 days ago and premium offers are in effect for him?
Qdrant will be able to handle this and such conditions.
