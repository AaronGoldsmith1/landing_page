Users, like text and pictures, can be represented as a semantic vector.
This vector can represent the user's preferences, behavior patterns, or interest in the product.

With Qdrant, user vectors can be updated in real-time, no need to deploy a MapReduce cluster.
Besides, Qdrant will allow you to place arbitrary restrictions on recommendations.
What if the user signed up 3 days ago and premium offers are in effect for him?
Qdrant will be able to handle this and such conditions.
