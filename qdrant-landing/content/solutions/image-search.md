Sometimes text search is not enough. 

Find similar images, detect duplicates, or even find a picture by text description - all of that you can do with Qdrant.
Mostly you won't even need to train a neural network for that. Pre-trained models are usually enough to begin with. 

And with Qdrant filters, you can apply arbitrary business logic on top of a similarity search.
Look for similar clothes cheaper than $20? Search for a similar artwork published in the last year?
Qdrant handles all of these conditions!

For the Demo, we put together a food discovery service - it will show you a lunch based on what you visually like or dislike. It can also search for a place near you. And we didn't train any neural network for that.
